whenever you go to a website you can see the data and the perform actions for example we aee looking at a github repository over here you can see the data about the specific repository you can see that it has 431 stars you can also see the different branches so on this website you can see a lot of data in addition you can also perform actions on this specific repository. 

How about enehancing your REST API to tell consumers how to perform subsequent actions?

so the question heteos is asking is how about enhancing your rest api not only to give the data back but also to give the information back about how to perform actions on those resources.

		{
			"name":"Adam",
   			"birthDate":"2022-08-16",
      			"_links": {
	 			"all-users": {
     					"href":"http://localhost:8085/users"
	  			}
      			}
	 	}

   
over here you can see that we have the name, birthdate as the response in addition we also have links in here which tell consumer how to perform subsequent actions, if you want to implement some thing like that you have couple of options.

1. Custom Format and Implementation
   	Difficult to maintain
2. Use Standard Implementation
   	HAL (JSON Hypertext Application Language): Simple format that gives a consistent easy way to hyperlink between resources in your API
